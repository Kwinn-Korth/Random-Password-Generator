# Random Password Generator

## Description
A very basic password generator I made to help understand JS and get some more time in it.


## Usage

Anyone can use it or add to it

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

The initial html and css code was provided by  friendly parakeet (https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/friendly-parakeet) .
My friend Nick helped me to make it look better and actualy work.
